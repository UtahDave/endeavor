About
=====

stravacmd is a Python command line tool for interfacing with
[Strava](https://www.strava.com).  It uses
[pystrava](https://github.com/j2sol/pystrava) to communicate with the Strava
API.

For your convenience pystrava is setup as a submodule of this checkout. You can
get it via running:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

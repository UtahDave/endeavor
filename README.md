About
=====

stravacmd is a Python command line tool for interfacing with
[Strava](https://www.strava.com).  It uses
[pystrava](https://github.com/j2sol/pystrava) to communicate with the Strava
API.

To run directly from a checkout, clone pystrava in another directory and link pystrava/src/pystrava to src/pystrava within stravacmd.
